In this assignment, you will apply your knowledge of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and
PyTorch to build a sentiment analysis model. Sentiment analysis is a common Natural
Language Processing (NLP) task where the objective is to classify sentences into different
sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. This task is widely used in various
applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market
research.
To achieve this, you will use the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset, a benchmark
dataset in sentiment analysis. The assignment will guide you through downloading and
preprocessing the SST dataset using the torchtext library, building a vocabulary, and
splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
You will then construct an RNN model to perform sentiment analysis. The model will be built
using PyTorch, and you will be provided with several key hyperparameters, such as
vocabulary size, embedding dimension, and hidden layer dimension. Your task is to complete
the implementation of the RNN model, including the embedding layer, the recurrent layer,
and the fully connected layer.
After building the model, you will train it on the SST dataset and evaluate its performance on
the validation and test sets. You are encouraged to experiment with different optimizers, such
as SGD and Adam, and to fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the model's accuracy.
By the end of this assignment, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement RNNs
for sentiment analysis and how to optimize their performance using PyTorch. This hands-on
experience will be valuable in applying deep learning techniques to various NLP tasks in your
future projects.
